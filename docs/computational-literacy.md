# computational literacy

an underlying theme of `midgy` is finding pleasure in reading and writing code. these computational literacies are now basic life skills for the members of the [global village]. our lives are so influenced software that reading code is almost essential to feeling personal safety in our digital and physical lives. throughout this work we'll explore themes around computational literacy as we build a language that provides equity to both _old_ textual and _new_ computational literacies.

[donald knuth] - [the patron saint of yak shaves] - is a titanic figure in the history of computational literacy. he's perfected [the letter __S__], authored the art of a computer programming [^century], and invented tex - a critical medium for scientific and mathematical literature. perhaps one of knuth's most prescient and progressive ideas was expressed in his [literate programming] paper. in this work he describes an approach to programming that elevates the literary quality of programs. the outcomes are multilingual documents wherein code and narrative cooperate in a way that reaches unique literary positions. literate programs are new media that reach places that pure narrative or code cannot acheive.

[donald knuth] is not only admirable for his technical contributions. his design accumen and spirit are apparent in all of his works. many of his ideas enhance the stories we can tell with computers, and consequently all of science. his apparent joy for computing, and writing programs, has been transmitted to all of us osmotically. now we're responsible to explore a world where we write programs of literary and computational excellence, we'll walk the interface between narrative and code to discover new literary affordances.

once you've read knuth its easy to dismiss a bulk of modern science literature as dilute of spirt and joy. this is noted by semiotician roland barthes where he suggests:

> There is, finally  between science and literature, a third margin which science must reconquer, that of pleasure[^pleasure]. 

`midgy` will allow us to explore the affordances brought by literate programs, moreover we'll start to explore a world where literate programming and interactive notebooks push our story telling capabilities.  we'll qualitatively measure `midgy` by our feelings when reading and writing programs, thereby upholding knuth's initial proposal that literate programming is fun. perhaps fun is a big burden to place on a piece of software, but wouldn't it be cool if it is actually so?
