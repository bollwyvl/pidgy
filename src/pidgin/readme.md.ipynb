    "## Modern notebooks and computatinal literacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Literate programming is a multi language style of programming to capture computational thinking in human computational logic.  Literate programs will interleave imperative and declarative programming styles within a narrative to describe a unit of computational thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "A literate programmer must make two choices:\n",
    "1. What markup language is the display written in?\n",
    "2. What source language does the kernel execute?\n",
    "\n",
    "Knuth's original paper of literate programming is an implementation using a Pascal kernel and Latex Markup language.  Since, there have been implementations in many languages, but the concept has not taking off for general programming where logic is driven by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Literate programs are an accumuluation of interactive computing sessions.  Fernando focuses closer to here. The composite of a literate program employs a word processor and kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> From this perspective, we therefore refer to the worfklow exposed by these kinds of computational notebooks (not just IPython, but also Sage, Mathematica and others), as \"literate computing\": it is the weaving of a narrative directly into a live computation, interleaving text with code and results to construct a complete piece that relies equally on the textual explanations and the computational components. For the goals of communicating results in scientific computing and data analysis, I think this model is a better fit than the literate programming one, which is rather aimed at developing software in tight concert with its design and explanatory documentation. I should note that we have some ideas on how to make IPython stronger as a tool for \"traditional\" literate programming, but it's a bit early for us to focus on that, as we first want to solidify the computational workflows possible with IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I don't take any issue with this approach per se, but I don't personally use it because it's not very well suited to the kinds of workflows that I need in practice. These require the frequent execution of small fragments of code, in an iterative cycle where code is run to obtain partial results that inform the next bit of code to be written. Such is the nature of interactive exploratory computing, which is the bread and butter of many practicing scientists. This is the kind of workflow that led me to creating IPython over a decade ago, and it continues to inform basically every decision we make in the project today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perez does not see IPython and literate programming as working becaues the original ltierate programming concept ignores the interactive and incremental work to compoe the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The notebook is designed to turn scientific programming into an interactive exercise, where individual commands were tweaked and rerun, perhaps dozens or hundreds of times, as the author learned from the results of their little computational experiments, and came to a more intimate understanding of their data.\n",
    ">> the scientific paper is obsolete\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Two core pieces of the project are an open protocol for interactive computation and an open document format with which to record and share computational ideas. The Jupyter Notebook application builds on these to provide a powerful, interactive, computational environment.\n",
    "Computational thinking will be a modern literacy.\n",

    "The [notebook interface][notebook interface] is a [literate programming][literate programming] environment.\n",

    "It pairs the functionality of word processing software with both the shell and kernel of that notebook's programming language. Millions of people use notebooks interfaces[2] to analyze data for science, journalism, and education.\n",
