# `midgy` minimal literate computing

`midgy` is a extension of python that allows for literate programming in notebooks and markdown files.

this project features some serious things and some fun things:

* a python package for literate progamming with documentation and tests

        pip install midgy

* a command line application for executing markdown files

        midgy filename.md

* interactive computing tools for jupyter notebooks

        %load_ext midgy

* a complete research paper describing the project and history

        nox -s docs

* a lot of care

a goal with `midgy`, and its derivatives, is to have fun writing and reading programs. to evoke joy in the author(s) and transmit their spirit. we'll begin by writing the programs we wish we'd read.
